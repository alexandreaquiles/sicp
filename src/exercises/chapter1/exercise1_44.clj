; Exercise 1.44:
; The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing.
; If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is the function
;   whose value at a point x is the average of f (x âˆ’ dx), f (x), and f (x + dx).
; Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes
;   the smoothed f.
; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on)
;   to obtain the n-fold smoothed function.
; Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.
