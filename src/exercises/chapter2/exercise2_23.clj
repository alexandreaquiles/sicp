; Exercise 2.23:
; The procedure for-each is similar to map.
; It takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements.
; However, rather than forming a list of the results, for-each just
;   applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from
; left to right.
; The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements are
;   not used at all â€” for-each is used with procedures that perform
;   an action, such as printing. For example,
;
;   (for-each (lambda (x)
;               (newline)
;               (display x))
;             (list 57 321 88))
;   57
;   321
;   88

; The value returned by the call to for-each (not illustrated
;   above) can be something arbitrary, such as true.
; Give an implementation of for-each.

(defn for-each [proc items]
  (if (empty? items)

      (proc (first items))
      (for-each proc (rest items)))))

          (list 57 321 88))
; 57

; => true
